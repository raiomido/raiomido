### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Rai Omido** 

I am a Nairobi-based âœ¨**Fullstack Software engineer**âœ¨.

My experience includes **developing and maintaining robust back-end systems**, **designing APIs**, and **optimizing database performance**.

My tech stack of choice is âœ¨**Ruby on Rails**âœ¨, **React JS**, and **Tailwind CSS**, but I can also build very robust systems using **Laravel**, **WordPress**, and **VueJS**.

For deployment, I like to deploy both the front-end and backend to **Digital Ocean** and serve static files through a custom CDN service via **Digital Ocean Spaces**.

Here are some facts about me:
